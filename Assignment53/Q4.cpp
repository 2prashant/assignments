4. What is the time complexity of the following code :
void fun(int n)
{
for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++)
for (int j = 1; j + n / 2 <= n; j++)
for (int k = 1; k <= n; k = k * 2)
cout << "Prateek Jain";
}
(problem 5 to 10 each of the following recurrences, give an expression for the
runtime T (n) if the recurrence can be solved with the Master Theorem. )
