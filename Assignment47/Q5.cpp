5. Given an array arr[] consisting of N integers and an integer X, the task is to perform
integer division on the array elements by X and print the indices of the array in
non-decreasing order of their quotients obtained.
Examples:
Input: N = 3, X = 3, order[] = {2, 7, 4}
Output: 1 3 2
Explanation:
After dividing the array elements by 3, the array modifies to {0, 2, 1}. Therefore,
the required order of output is 1 3 2.
Input: N = 5, X = 6, order[] = {9, 10, 4, 7, 2}
Output: 3 5 1 2 4
Explanation:
After dividing the array elements by 6, the array elements modify to 1 1 0 1 0.
Therefore, the required sequence is 3 5 1 2 4.
