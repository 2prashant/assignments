10. Given a doubly linked list containing N nodes, the task is to remove all the nodes
from the list which contains Fibonacci numbers.
Example:
Input: DLL = 15 <=> 16 <=> 8 <=> 7 <=> 13
Output: 15 <=> 16 <=> 7
Explanation:
The linkedlist contains two fibonacci numbers 8 and 13.
Hence, these nodes have been deleted.
Input: DLL = 5 <=> 3 <=> 4 <=> 2 <=> 9
Output: 4 <=> 9
Explanation:
The linked list contains three fibonacci numbers 5, 3 and 2.
Hence, these nodes have been deleted.
