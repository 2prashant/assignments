2. Write a C++ program to delete all copies from an unordered_multiset.
Example:
Input - 6 4 2 7 3 3 1 1 1
Output - 6 4 2 7 3 1
3. Given an array arr[] of N integer elements, the task is to change the minimum
number of elements of this array such that it contains first N terms of the Catalan
Sequence. Thus, find the minimum changes required using unordered_multiset.
First few Catalan numbers are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, .....
Examples:
Input: arr[] = {4, 1, 2, 33, 213, 5}
Output: 3
We have to replace 4, 33, 213 with 1, 14, 42 to make the first 6 terms of Catalan
sequence.
Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 5, 41}
Output: 1
Simply change 41 with 14
4. Write a C++ program to illustrate the swapping of data between two
unordered_multiset.
5. Write a C++ program to count the frequency of elements in unordered_multiset.
6. Write a C++ program to illustrate the emplace() function in unordered_multiset.
7. Write a C++ program to illustrate the find() function in unordered_multiset.
8. Write a C++ program to illustrate the bucket_count() function in unordered_multiset.
9. Write a C++ program to illustrate the load_factor() function in unordered_multiset.
10. Write a C++ program to illustrate the reverse() function in unordered_multiset.
