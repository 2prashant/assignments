Graph
1. Breadth First Search or BFS for a Graph.
Output
Following is Breadth First Traversal (starting from vertex 2)
2 0 3 1
2. Given the adjacency list of a bidirectional graph. Your task is to copy/clone the 
adjacency list for each vertex and return a new list.
Example 1:
Input:
Output:
0->1 2
1->4 0 3 2
2->3 1 4
3->4 1
4->0
3. Given a binary 2D matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected 1s forms an 
island. For example, the below matrix contains 5 islands.
Example:
Input: mat[][] = {{1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
 {0, 1, 0, 0, 1},
 {1, 0, 0, 1, 1},
 {0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
 {1, 0, 1, 0, 0}}
Output: 5
4. Given an undirected graph, The task is to check if there is a cycle in the given graph.
Example:
Input: N = 4, E = 4
Detect cycle in an undirected graph 1
Output: Yes
Explanation: The diagram clearly shows a cycle 0 to 2 to 1 to 0
Input: N = 4, E = 3 , 0 1, 1 2, 2 3
Detect cycle in an undirected graph 2
Output: No
Explanation: There is no cycle in the given graph
5. Find whether it is possible to finish all tasks or not from given dependencies
Examples:
Input: 2, [[1, 0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 tasks to pick. To pick task 1 you should have 
finished task 0. So it is possible.
Input: 2, [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 tasks to pick. To pick task 1 you should have 
finished task 0, and to pick task 0 you should also have finished task 1. So it is 
impossible.
Input: 3, [[1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 2]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 3 tasks to pick. To pick tasks 1 you should have 
finished task 0, and to pick task 2 you should have finished task 1 and to pick 
task 3 you should have finished task 2. So it is possible.
6. Find the ordering of tasks from given dependencies
There are a total of n tasks you have to pick, labeled from 0 to n-1. Some tasks may 
have prerequisites tasks, for example to pick task 0 you have to first finish tasks 1, which 
is expressed as a pair: [0, 1] Given the total number of tasks and a list of prerequisite 
pairs, return the ordering of tasks you should pick to finish all tasks. There may be 
multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all 
tasks, return an empty array. Examples:
Input: 2, [[1, 0]]
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 tasks to pick. To pick task 1 you should have 
finished task 0. So the correct task order is [0, 1] .
Input: 4, [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]]
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3] or [0, 2, 1, 3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 tasks to pick. To pick task 3 you should have 
finished both tasks 1 and 2. Both tasks 1 and 2 should be pick after you finished 
task 0. So one correct task order is [0, 1, 2, 3]. Another correct ordering is [0, 2, 
1, 3].
7. Given a snake and ladder board, find the minimum number of dice throws required to 
reach the destination or last cell from the source or 1st cell. Basically, the player has total 
control over the outcome of the dice throw and wants to find out the minimum number of throws 
required to reach the last cell. If the player reaches a cell which is the base of a ladder, the 
player has to climb up that ladder and if reaches a cell is the mouth of the snake, and has to go 
down to the tail of the snake without a dice throw.
8. Count the total number of ways or paths that exist between two vertices in a directed 
graph. These paths donâ€™t contain a cycle, the simple enough reason is that a cycle contains an 
infinite number of paths and hence they create a problem.
Input: Count paths between A and E
Output: Total paths between A and E are 4
Explanation: The 4 paths between A and E are:
 A -> E
 A -> B -> E
 A -> C -> E
 A -> B -> D -> C -> E
Input: Count paths between A and C
Output: Total paths between A and C are 2
Explanation: The 2 paths between A and C are:
 A -> C
 A -> B -> D -> C
9. Write a function to find a mother vertex in the graph.
What is a Mother Vertex?
A mother vertex in a graph G = (V, E) is a vertex v such that all other vertices in G can 
be reached by a path from v
10. Given n and k, construct a palindrome of size n using a binary number of size k 
repeating itself to wrap into the palindrome. The palindrome must always begin with 1 and 
contains maximum number of zeros.
Examples :
Input : n = 5, k = 3
Output : 11011
Explanation : the 3 sized substring is
110 combined twice and trimming the extra
0 in the end to give 11011
